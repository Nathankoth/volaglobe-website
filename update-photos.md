# Photo Update Instructions

## Current Issue
The new photo files were created as placeholders (copies of existing photos) instead of using the actual new photos you provided.

## Files to Replace

### 1. Ugoji Nkechika Christian
**File to replace:** `src/assets/ugoji_nkechika_christian_new.jpg`
**Action:** Replace this file with the new professional portrait you provided

### 2. Akintunde Abimbola Agbonde  
**File to replace:** `src/assets/akintunde_abimbola_agbonde_new.jpg`
**Action:** Replace this file with the new professional portrait you provided

## Steps to Fix

1. **For Ugoji's photo:**
   - Take the new professional portrait you provided
   - Save it as `src/assets/ugoji_nkechika_christian_new.jpg` (overwrite the existing file)

2. **For Akintunde's photo:**
   - Take the new professional portrait you provided  
   - Save it as `src/assets/akintunde_abimbola_agbonde_new.jpg` (overwrite the existing file)

3. **After replacing both files:**
   - Run `npm run build` to test
   - The new photos will appear on the website

## Current Status
- ✅ Configuration is correct (imports point to the new files)
- ❌ Image files need to be replaced with actual new photos
- ✅ Build system is ready to process the new images

Once you replace the image files, the new photos will automatically appear on the website with the same circular styling (150px × 150px) as the other team members.
